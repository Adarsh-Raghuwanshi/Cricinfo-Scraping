# Cricket Website Scrapping

Hi Everyone!üòÄüòÄ

I made a project based on Web Scraping.üòç

Here I extracted teams data of cricket world cup 2019 (Men's)
Used the data to edit a design template that I 
made and make scorecards of each teams in pdf file, write the match summary in a CSV file and also scrape those scorecards in qrcode(you can scan them to get the particular match's summary)....Explored and tried a few npm libraries. 
Learned about dependencies on other libraries. 
Had a lot of fun building this.




## Node modules used

- To get data of cricinfo worldcup 2019 (axios)
- To Process data : Get all teams (jsdom)
- Write processed data in excel : Match results per team in their own sheet (excel4node)
- Create Folders : One for each team (fs)
- Write Files : PDF file for scorecard of each match in relevant folder (pdf-lib)
- To scrape data : Make qrcode of scorecard (qrcode)
